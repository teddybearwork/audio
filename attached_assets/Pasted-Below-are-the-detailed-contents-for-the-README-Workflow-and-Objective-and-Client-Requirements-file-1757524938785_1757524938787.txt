markdown# Animal Sound Recognition System

## Overview
This project is a Python-based module designed to recognize specific animal, bird, and background noise sounds from a live audio stream captured via a MEMS low-noise single microphone module (3.3V) over a WebSocket connection (WiFi/LAN). The system processes audio in real-time, identifies sounds with a confidence threshold of ≥80%, and logs results (sound, timestamp, confidence) to a CSV file. The system is built as a lightweight command-line interface (CLI) tool, optimized for low-latency detection (~200–500ms) and robust performance in noisy environments.

## Features
- **Real-Time Audio Processing**: Captures live audio from a MEMS microphone via WebSocket, processes it in small windows (1–2 seconds), and outputs recognized sounds instantly.
- **Sound Classification**: Recognizes 24 distinct animal, bird, and background noise sounds provided by the client, with additional noise classes sourced from open datasets.
- **High Accuracy**: Uses a deep learning model (YAMNet-based transfer learning) with a confidence threshold of ≥80% to minimize false positives.
- **Noise Robustness**: Handles environmental noises (e.g., water, leaves, cave echoes, crickets) through data augmentation and noise filtering.
- **Logging**: Exports detection results (sound, timestamp, confidence) to a CSV file for record-keeping.
- **Low-Latency**: Implements a circular buffer for smooth streaming and optimized sliding windows for real-time inference.
- **Testing Support**: Includes an option to test with a laptop microphone for validation before deploying with the MEMS microphone.

## Prerequisites
- **Python**: Version 3.8 or higher
- **Dependencies**: Install required libraries using:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt

Hardware:

MEMS low-noise single microphone module (3.3V) for production.
Laptop microphone for testing.


Network: Stable WiFi/LAN connection for WebSocket-based audio streaming.
Audio Files: 24 client-provided audio files (MP3) for animals and birds, hosted on Google Drive or GitHub repository.

Installation

Clone the repository:
bashgit clone https://github.com/<your-repo>/animal-sound-recognition.git
cd animal-sound-recognition

Install dependencies:
bashpip install -r requirements.txt

Download the audio dataset from the provided Google Drive link or GitHub repository and place it in the data/ directory.
Configure WebSocket settings in config.yaml (update host, port, etc., as needed).

Usage

Run the CLI tool:
bashpython main.py --input websocket --url ws://<websocket-server>:<port>
For testing with a laptop microphone:
bashpython main.py --input laptop

The system will start processing live audio and output recognized sounds to the console with confidence scores.
Detection results are logged to output/detections.csv in the format:
texttimestamp,sound,confidence

Notes

The system is designed for a fixed set of 24 sounds and does not support retraining for new sounds, as per client requirements.
Background noises (e.g., water, leaves, cave echoes, crickets) are sourced from open datasets (ESC-50, UrbanSound8K, FreeSound) and mixed with client audio during training.
The model is optimized for low-latency detection (~200–500ms) using a circular buffer and sliding window approach.
The WebSocket implementation ensures compatibility with the MEMS microphone module over WiFi/LAN.
For debugging or issues, check logs/app.log for detailed error messages.

Limitations

Requires a stable network connection for WebSocket streaming.
Performance may vary in extremely noisy environments, though noise filtering and augmentation mitigate this.
No GUI provided, as per client preference for a lightweight CLI tool.
